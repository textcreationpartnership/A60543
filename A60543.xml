            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Now this curſe and maledi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the law hath Chriſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergone for vs, according to that prophecy of old:
<note place="margin">Eſay 53.4.</note>

               </p>
               <p>And thus was Chriſt made vnder the law, the law deeming and reputing Chriſt the Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſor, and inflicting vpon him both in ſoul and body, the whole curſe and malediction of the law. And indeed the wrath of God for the ſins of the world lay ſo heauy vpon him as that it pierced his very ſoule: For had Chriſt ſuffred onely in body, then had he onely ouercome a bodily death, &amp; then were our eſtate moſt miſerable.</p>
               <p>But our ſinnes hauing deſerued not onely a bodily death, but euen the ſecond death, the death of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and ſoule; it was therefore ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie that Chriſt ſhould ſatisfie the wrath and Iuſtice of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for both.</p>
               <p>And indeed whence was it that

Though the Lord delighteth not in the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of men, yet he delighteth in his owne Iuſtice, according to which puniſhment is due.

                     <note place="margin">Ezek. 34.2.4.</note> nor <hi>healed the ſicke, nor bound vp the broken.</hi> And this, no doubt, added much to <hi>Dauids</hi> griefe, that at the

                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 3.2.</note> This was the ſinne of cruell <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his people,

                  <p>And this was the great fault of <hi>Eliphaz, Bildad,</hi> and <hi>Zophar, Iobs</hi> three friends, that beholding <hi>Iob,</hi> this ſeruant of God, ſo ſorely op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed with miſery, inſtead of ſupporting him vnder that heauy burthen, they charged him for an hypocrite, and ſo added vnto his ſorrowes.

<note place="margin">Mat. 25.40</note> and ye fed me not: naked, and ye cloathed mee not: ſicke, and in priſon, and ye viſited me not.</hi> All which teſtimonies, as a cloud of witneſſes, conclude this truth, that to adde to the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries of the afflicted, and not to veeld them comfort in time of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe, is a grieuous ſinne. And there is reaſon for it. For,</p>

<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſ. </seg>1</label> it makes the burthen of a mans ſorrows by this meanes the more heauy. For indeed there is nothing more grieuous vnto our natures, nor can go nearer the
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:42465:57"/>heart of man in time of affliction, then for a man to perceiue him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to be deſpiſed, and caſt off of others. And no doubt it was not the leaſt of thoſe ſorrowes that wounded the heart of our bleſſed Sauiour, that hee could ſay as it was propheſied of him before, <hi>I am a worme and not a man,
<note place="margin">Pſa. 22.6.7</note> a ſhame of men, and the contempt of the people. All they that ſee me haue me in deriſion,</hi> &amp;c.

                  <p>Secondly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> it is a grieuous ſinne to adde affliction to the afflicted, becauſe by this meanes we helpe to ſtrengthen Sathans temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, who ſeeks by all meanes poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to ouerwhelme the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in the gulſe of their preſent
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:42465:58"/>ſorrowes.

                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 2.7.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> wee doe not know what need we ourſelues may haue in time to come, there is none of Gods ſeruants caſt ſo low, in mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery and ſorrow, but we our ſelues are liable vnto the ſame, haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued the ſame, and why then ſhould we not feare, and expect it? Now who would not be comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in time of ſorrow? Surely it is Gods mercy to his people in
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:42465:58"/>times of affliction, that they ſuffer not alone, but haue others ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathizing with them, who are ready to put vnder their hands, &amp; by their godly counſels, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, prayers and ſupplications, are ready to help to beare vp the burthen that they ſinke not.</p>
                  <p>And indeed, wee often finde this rule of our Sauiour verified amongſt men, <hi>with what meaſure weniete to others,
<note place="margin">Mat. 7.3.</note> the very ſame ſhall be meaſured to vs againe.</hi> If we ſhew that godly and Chriſtian charity to comfort others in their diſtreſſe, wee ſhall not our ſelues want comfort in our greateſt need, as wee ſhall ſee in the penitent Thiefe hereafter.</p>
                  <p>If then in time of our afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<label type="milestone">

                  <p>Secondly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> it may admoniſh vs that wee labour more and more with our ſelues, &amp; with our owne hearts, that we get this Chriſtian affection towards our brethren, in time of miſery, that wee may <hi>mourne with them that mourne,</hi> and be like affected one towards another, and the rather for that it declares a man to bee a liuely member of that myſticall body, whereof the Lord Ieſus Chriſt is the head, who is affectionate to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:42465:59"/>all his members. Whereas the want of this affection argueth that wee are dead members, and were neuer truely ingrafted into that body.</p>
                  <p>And laſt of all, in Chriſt thus railed vpon and reproached by this wicked man, we may ſee vnto what a neere ebbe the Lord brings his people many times here in this life,

This was the ſinne of our firſt parents, albeit God had ſaid,
<note place="margin">Gen. 3.3.</note> 
                  <hi>Ye ſhall not eate thereof, neither ſhall ye touth it, leſt yee dye.</hi> As the woman confeſſed to Sathan, yet for want of faith to beleeue the truth of Gods word, they eate the forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den fruite, and ſo brought Gods wrath vpon them and their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteritie.</p>
               <p>This was the ſinne of the <hi>Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites,</hi> who albeit they had expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of Gods power and might in bringing them out of Egypt,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:42465:62"/>and that miraculous deliuerance ſhewed them from the crueltie of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and that through the Red-ſea: yet vpon euery light oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion called they ſtill Gods loue, power, goodneſſe and mercy into queſtion, as if they had no expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience at any time of the ſame. Thus then they murmure in the wilderneſſe,
<note place="margin">Numb. 11.18.19. Pſal. 78.19.20.</note> when they wanted meate, <hi>Can God prepare a table in the wilderneſſe? Can he prepare flaſh for his people?</hi> Howſoeuer this people were guiltie of many ſinnes, yet this, this ſinne of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelitie</hi> was that ſinne that in ſo ſpeciall a manner prouoked the Lord to wrath againſt them; for ſo ſaith the Text:
<note place="margin">Pſa. 78.21.</note> 
                  <hi>Therefore the Lord heard and was angry, and the fire was kindled in Iacob, and alſo wrath came vpon Iſrael.</hi> But what might be the reaſon thereof? <hi>Becauſe they beleeued not in God,

                     <pb n="118" facs="tcp:42465:63"/>and trusted not in his helpe.</hi> And albeit the Lord ſware vnto their Fathers, that he would giue vnto them the Land of <hi>Canaan:</hi>

What might be the cauſe? Surely they ſtood guiltie before the Lord of many ſinnes, ſuch as were their idolatry, whoredome, &amp;c. but aboue all other, that which the Lord was moſt of all diſpleaſed at, was their <hi>Infidelity,</hi> for ſo ſaith the holy Ghoſt,
<note place="margin">Heb. 3.19.</note> 
                  <hi>They could not enter in becauſe of vnbeleefe.</hi> This appeares likewiſe in the example of that Prince in <hi>Samaria,</hi> that would not beleeue the Prophet touching the great plentie which he propheſied ſhould be in <hi>Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,</hi>

               <p>Another memorable example hereof we haue recorded by the Euangeliſt;
<note place="margin">Mark. 6.5.</note> That when our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour came to the City of <hi>Naza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth,</hi> there to preach, and to ſhew his power, the Text ſaith, <hi>Hee could do no great works there:</hi>

<note place="margin">Mat. 13.58</note> 
                  <hi>Becauſe of their vnbeleefe.</hi> The <hi>Infidelity</hi> and vnbeleefe that was amongſt them, did after a ſort binde the hands of our bleſſed Sauiour, that he could not do the good he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired amongſt them.</p>
               <p>This doctrine might bee fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inſiſted vpon by the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples

                  <p>Or if men doe ſpeake of the ſinnes of others, it is behind their backs in the moſt vildeſt and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gracefulleſt manner that may be.

<pb n="210" facs="tcp:42465:109"/>ſeeke by all meanes poſſible, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer them into the ſtate of grace. No doubt it pierced this Penitent Thiefe to the heart, to heare him blaſpheme and raile on Chriſt, he can by no meanes beare it. But howſoeuer his owne griefe was great, and paine grieuous, he ſeemeth to neglect all, and falleth to the rebuking of his fellow, ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning againſt God; this will a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions heart do.

                  <p>Secondly,

For indeed no man loueth naturally, that doth not loue ſpiritually; for by how much the more excellent the ſoule is aboue the body, by ſo much the more excellent is the loue to it, aboue that of the body. And indeed this will be a ſound witneſſe vnto our hearts, of our loue towards others, in that wee haue admoniſhed our brethren, and ſought by all meanes poſſible to recouer them from their ſinfull waies.

And thus farre we are ſure we ſhall glorifie God, to be witneſſes of his word and truth; when the wicked in the laſt day ſhall be put to ſilence, not being able to plead ignorance, or that they had no warning.</p>
                  <p>And let vs know that the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God bloweth where it liſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and the Lord can euen of <hi>Lyons, Tygers,</hi> and <hi>Cockatrices,</hi> make at his pleaſure to become the ſheepe of Chriſt: of <hi>Abraham</hi> an Idolater, he can make the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the faithfull; of bloudie and barbarous <hi>Manaſſes,</hi> he can make an humble Conuert; and of a perſecuting <hi>Saul,</hi> he can make a painfull preaching <hi>Paul:</hi> and of a lewd graceleſſe Theefe, an holy confeſſour. Let none therefore be

                  <p>And laſt of all,

                  <p>Wee may ſee this likewiſe in <hi>Oneſimus,</hi> whom <hi>Paul</hi> ſent backe vnto his Maſter <hi>Philemon</hi> with this teſtimony, that howſoeuer in times paſt, that is, before his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſion, he was vnprofitable, yet now ſaith <hi>Paul, is profitable to thee and me.</hi>

                  <p>Firſt, in regard of the nature and propertie of grace it ſelfe, which is of a generatiue nature,
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:42465:114"/>producing grace; this Talent can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bee hid or kept cloſe in the heart without profit or increaſe. Indeed the common gifts of the ſpirit, ſuch as are giuen many times to the wicked themſelues, theſe are not ſo profitable, becauſe they are but common gifts; but where the ſanctified graces of Gods ſpirit are, <hi>They are</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>giuen to edifie withall,</hi> and theſe are neuer idle nor vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable in the heart of a true beleeuer.

                  <p>Secondly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> the godly know right well that the gifts and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the ſpirit are giuen to the ſame end: <hi>viz.</hi> that the body of Chriſt might be edified; hence is it that the Lord Ieſus doth ſo ſtraightly inioyne <hi>Peter, When

                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, there is no ſeruice that a Chriſtian can doe in the Church, that hath the like pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of recompence or reward, as that which extendeth to the ſoules of men. <hi>Let him know that he that hath conuerted his brother,

                  <p>Secondly,

The like we may ſee in <hi>Hezechiah,</hi> in <hi>Iob,</hi> and in all Gods people: if there be any faith, any hope, any grace at all in the heart of man, now is the time for the exerciſe thereof, when afflictions, eſpecially ſuch as ſummon to death and iudgement; are vpon vs. It ſeemed vnto this godly Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, a moſt hainous thing indeed in his fellow, yea, the height and top of all impietie, that now the hand of God was vpon him, and hee ſo ſhortly to depart this life,
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:42465:130"/>and to make his laſt account be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Iudge of all the world, that he ſhould in this reprochfull manner blaſpheme an innocent, euen the Lord Ieſus Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, before whom he was ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to appeare, and to giue account of all the things that he had done in the fleſh.</p>
                  <p>But what ſhall I ſay? There are ſome whom al the torments in the world cannot moue or make them better; ſickneſſe, pouertie, ſhame in the world, all the buffettings of Sathan, or miſeries that can bee thought vpon, alas, moue them not, nor any whit affect them, to worke remorſe of conſcience, compunction or ſorrow for ſinne, to make them any whit the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. But what may be the reaſon? can any affliction preſſe out of the creature, that was neuer in it? If a whole mountaine were laid vpon
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:42465:130"/>a dry or rotten ſticke, will it yeeld any ſappe? no, no, it will firſt be ground to powder. The impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Thiefe for all his miſery that he was in, or thoughts of death, or of iudgement, that now were vpon him, is not brought to the leaſt remorſe of conſcience for ſin; but the Penitent Thiefe he being vnder the ſame affliction, yeelds the ſweet ſap and liquor of faith and repentance; he confeſſeth his ſinnes, pleads Chriſts cauſe, and compaſſionates the miſery of his fellow, and ſhewes moſt admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble fruits of repentance. Yea, if there bee any grace at all in the heart of man, now is the time for it to ſhew it ſelfe, otherwiſe wee periſh without hope.</p>
                  <p>Seeing then that afflictions ſhould thus make vs to looke home,

<pb n="265" facs="tcp:42465:136"/>it is hee onely that hath power to forgiue ſinnes. This truth is confeſſed by the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees,</hi> whoſe iudgements howſoeuer they were corrupt in many things, yet were ſound in this,
<note place="margin">Mar. 2.7.</note> 
                     <hi>Who can forgiue ſinnes</hi> (ſay they) <hi>but God onely?</hi> Now reaſon would that we make confeſſion of our ſinnes onely to him that hath power to forgiue ſinnes. But this is onely in God, therefore to him muſt we go to make confeſſion of the ſame.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> confeſſion of ſinnes is neceſſarie, in regard it is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent thing to glorifie God. As wee haue diſhonoured him by ſinne, by an heartie confeſſion of the ſame, we honour him againe; for herein wee acknowledge his principall attributes, namely, his omniſcience, omnipreſence, pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, iuſtice, mercy, &amp;c. And this is
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:42465:137"/>the reaſon that <hi>Ioſuah</hi> vrgeth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Acan,
<note place="margin">Ioſ. 7.19.</note> My ſonne, I pray thee giue glory to God, and confeſſe thy fault.</hi> Where he ioynes theſe two together, <hi>Gods glory,</hi> and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of our faults. For ſinne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed doth not ſerue more to the diſhonour of God, then doth an heartie confeſſion of the ſame, ſerue to his honour. And this is the reaſon why Gods ſeruants hauing ſinned, haue beene content to ſhame themſelues, by confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the ſame, knowing indeed it would bring ſo much glorie to God.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> the conſcionable per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of this duty is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent meanes to keepe the heart vpright with God for future times, and ſo a notable preſerua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue againſt ſinne. For that man that hath once done his penance before God in that kinde freely,
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:42465:137"/>penitently, and heartily, it will be a coraſiue vnto his heart all the dayes of his life after, and make him to dread thoſe ſins that bring ſuch a taile of ſorrow with them in the end.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> by our acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſinne we cleare the Lords iuſtice, and iuſtiſie his Maieſtie, in puniſhing vs for the ſame. Thus <hi>Dauid</hi> is led vnto this duty to make an hearty confeſſion of his ſinnes,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 51.4.</note> 
                     <hi>That thou</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>maiſt be iuſtified in thy ſayings, and true when thou iudgeſt.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Nehe. 1.7. Dan. 9.5. Ezra 9.6.</note> This is cleare likewiſe in thoſe excellent prayers of <hi>Nehemiah, Daniel, Ezra,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>And laſt of all,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> by recounting duely our ſinnes, and making due acknowledgement of the ſame, our hearts are the better fitted for prayer, and for all holy duties publicke and priuate, this makes vs earneſt and affectionate in the
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:42465:138"/>ſuites we put vp to God, for ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer is a poore ſinner more earneſt in his requeſts for mercy, then when hee is moſt ſenſible of his owne miſerie, and in the ſence thereof hath beene led to an hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie acknowledgement of the ſame. This makes men importunate ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
<note place="margin">Dan. 9.19. Ezra 9.6. Nehe. 1.11 Mat. 15.</note> ſuch as will haue no nay, as it appeares in <hi>Daniel, Ezra, Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid,</hi> the Cananitiſh woman, and the like.</p>

<pb n="270" facs="tcp:42465:139"/>one for his turne.</p>
                  <p>But doth not Saint <hi>Iames</hi> ſay,

                  <p>This is the Scripture I confeſſe that is principally vrged by our Aduerſaries,

                     </label> to warrant their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of <hi>Auricular</hi> confeſſion. But by this Scripture the Prieſt is bound as ſtraightly to ſhriue him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to the penitent, as the peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to the Prieſt, for S. <hi>Iames</hi> requires it as a mutuall duty.</p>
                  <p>Indeed that there is a lawfull and commendable duty to bee performed amongſt Chriſtians in confeſſing of their faults one to another, was neuer denyed by vs, it is that wee often call vpon and prouoke men vnto. But yet in theſe two caſes eſpecially.</p>
                  <p>Firſt,
<note place="margin">Caſes of priuate confeſſion</note> in priuate and perſonall iniuries and wrongs done one to another, it is requiſite that wee
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:42465:139"/>ſhould come and confeſſe our faults one to another, and to ſeeke forgiueneſſe, and to labour a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, in caſe of trouble of conſcience, to the end wee may not ſink vnder the burthen there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, or any way giue aduantage vnto Sathan to haue the greater power ouer vs, it is an excellent thing to disburthen our ſoules by confeſſion of our particular ſinnes vnto ſome godly Miniſter, or ſome faithfull Chriſtian, that is knowne to be a man of wiſedome and conſcience, able to miniſter comfort: in theſe caſes it is a moſt commendable dutie.</p>
                  <p>But we hold it not as a matter of abſolute neceſſitie to confeſſe vnto men, as the Church of Rome doth, neither do we tye this duty to the Prieſts eare, but hold that it may bee performed alſo to a
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:42465:140"/>faithfull Chriſtian, albeit but a priuate man who is able to mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter a word of comfort, and to beare anothers burthen in loue.</p>
                  <p>Secondly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> this ſhewes how farre ſuch men are from true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance that are ſtrangers vnto this dutie of <hi>Confeſsion.</hi> Faine they would haue God to pardon their ſinnes, but they yet neuer framed any Inditement againſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues; faine they would eſcape the iudgement of God, but they cannot endure to iudge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues. And of theſe there are foure ſorts.</p>
                  <p>Firſt,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> ſuch as are ignorant of their owne eſtates, and of their owne miſerie by reaſon of ſinne, theſe men reſt with this generall acknowledgement of ſinne, <hi>We are all ſinners.</hi> And, <hi>God forgiue vs, there is none without ſinne.</hi> But yet they neuer came truly to
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:42465:140"/>ſee any one ſinne, how ſinne hath made them guilty of Gods wrath and vengeance, and without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, makes them liable vnto euerlaſting damnation: this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of ſinne whileſt they are ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of, there can bee no true ioy nor heartie acknowledgement of ſinne, and ſo no hope of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don. It is the knowledge of the Word we know, that brings men to the ſight of their ſinnes, to an hearty acknowledgement of the ſame to God, and teacheth them how to pray for the pardon of the ſame, which whileſt men remaine ignorant of, it is impoſſible to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme theſe duties aright.</p>
                  <p>Secondly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> ſuch as hide their ſinnes, and conceale them, yea, if they be told of them, will outface them like <hi>Gehezi,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Reg. 5.25. Acts 5.3.</note> who being que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioned of his Maſter, <hi>Thy Seruant went no whither,</hi> ſaith he; and this

We haue too many of ſuch amongſt vs, that vnleſſe you bee able to teſtifie vpon proofe, will hardly be brought to confeſſe any thing: wherein the policy of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than doth notably appeare, to take away ſhame where it ſhould be in the committing of ſinne, and to put it where it ſhould not be, in the confeſſion of the ſame. Whereas a true confeſſor will bee his owne greateſt enemie, racking his ſinne to the vtmoſt pin, that God may haue the glory, and the ſinner his deſerued ſhame.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> thoſe that Phariſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally ſtand vpon their owne righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, and haue got a who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh forehead to defend their ſins;
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:42465:141"/>this is that corruption wee haue drawne from our firſt Parents. How did <hi>Adam</hi> poſt off the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to his Wife, when the Lord expoſtulated the matter with him;
<note place="margin">Gen. 3.12.13.</note> 
                     <hi>The woman</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>whom thou gaueſt me, ſhe gaue me of the fruit, and I did eate.</hi> And the woman, ſhe laid the blame vpon the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, and thus ſinne is poaſted off from one to another. Thus is it now, no ſinne can be ſo vile, but men are ready to plead for it, and therein hold a buckler ouer Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thans head, for feare he ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue a blow. Drunkenneſſe, ſay they, is but good fellowſhip, whordome and vncleaneneſſe but a tricke of youth, couetouſneſſe and vſury but good husbandry: Thus pay they one debt with another,
<note place="margin">Culpa cum defenditur geminatur.</note> and by excuſing and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending of ſinne, make themſelues more inexcuſable, and their ſinnes
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:42465:142"/>vnpardonable.</p>
                  <p>And yet we haue a fourth ſort of wicked men, that out-ſtrip all that went before, and they are ſuch who are ſo farre from confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing their ſins, as that they brag and boaſt of their vile abhomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; how they layd vp ſuch and ſuch to ſleepe at ſuch a time, what pranks they plaid elſewhere, ſome for Drunkenneſſe, ſome for vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleaneneſſe, ſome for one wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and ſome for another, <hi>who glory in their ſhame,</hi> and whoſe damnation doth not ſleepe. From whence ſhould I fetch the chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to hope of the conuerſion and ſaluation of ſuch a one? Surely if the Lord giue not a great meaſure of repentance, the very blackneſſe of darkeneſſe is reſerued for ſuch at the iudgement of the laſt day.</p>
                  <p>And laſt of all this may ſerue to exhort vs,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>3</label> that wee would euery

And that we may doe ſo, regard is to be had vnto three particulars.</p>
                  <p>Firſt,
<note place="margin">Properties of true confeſſion.</note> that our confeſſion of ſin proceed from a good ground,
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:42465:143"/>from a heart that is truely hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, and broken in the ſence of ſinne. For there is nothing can be more acceptable vnto God, then the heartie confeſſion of a ſinner, a confeſſion that comes from a broken heart. So <hi>Dauid, A bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and contrite heart,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 51.17</note> O God thou wilt not deſpiſe.</hi> Such was the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of the Publican, <hi>God bee mercifull to me a ſinner.</hi> He fetch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vp his conuerſion from his heart. That confeſſion of ſinne that comes but from the mouth, and not from the heart, returneth vnto vs againe emptie, without comfort, being in Gods eſteeme but a maymed ſacrifice, a lame of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering that is not accepted with him; and hence it is that all thoſe formall confeſſions of hypocrites and wicked men,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> that onely in times of aduerſitie,

<pb n="279" facs="tcp:42465:143"/>when the rod of God hath beene vpon them, as vpon <hi>Pharaoh, Saul, Iudas,</hi> &amp;c. and that for feare of further puniſhment, and not out of hatred againſt ſinne, hath beene in Gods eſteeme moſt ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hominable, no way mouing the Lord to pittie, nor to compaſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate his creature in their miſery.</p>
                  <p>Secondly,

<note place="margin">We muſt confeſſe our parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular ſins.</note> it is requiſite that wee ſhould come to particulars, not ſumming them vp together in a groſſe ſumme, but laying them o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen in the ſpeciall kindes thereof; euen as a Patient that is ſicke, layes open vnto the Phyſitian, euery particular of his infirmitie, in what place the griefe is, in what manner it holdeth him, when and how he is troubled; and thus haue the ſeruants of God done in their confeſſion of ſin, and haue found comfort therein: thus <hi>Dauid,

                  <p>Thirdly, vnto true confeſsion,

Doth he any way go about to excuſe his fact, that it was but that Courtlike entertainment fit for an Embaſſadour of ſo great a Prince, or the like. Surely no, but hee buckels handſomely to the iudgement threatned, being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious vnto his owne ſinne, and ſaith, <hi>The word of the Lord is good that thou haſt ſpoken.</hi> Excellent to this purpoſe is that of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Dauid,</hi> when <hi>Nathan</hi> the Lords Prophet had denounced thoſe ſeuerall iudgements againſt him and his houſe, that the Infant conceined in adultery ſhould die, that his owne wiues ſhould be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed, that the ſword ſhould neuer depart from his houſe.

But if on the contrary part vpon triall had, we finde that we were neuer yet ſo ſenſible of our ſinnes, nor apprehenſiue of our miſery, to know and acknowledge that we haue deſerued at Gods hand his ſharpeſt plagues, and ſeuereſt cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections, ſo that in the middeſt of them all wee could ſay,

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> this is it that diſtinguiſheth betweene the true Chriſtian, and the carnall profeſſor; the former is not aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of Chriſt, but continueth with him in temptations,

                  <p>No doubt this could not but be a corrafiue at the very heart of the high Prieſt and Elders, and people that purſued Chriſt to this death, to haue this man thus to acknowledge Chriſt. For it is commonly a matter of great weight whereon one taketh his death.</p>
                  <p>So in rebuking, exhorting, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhing, or any other dutie, when one vrgeth it dying, it leaues the greater impreſſion behinde it. The brethren of <hi>Ioſeph</hi> can pleade this to their brother:

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> the great coſt the Lord is daily at with vs, may prouoke vnto this duty. Firſt, hee bought vs at a deare rate, from

Lamentable is their eſtate, and wofull is their conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Of all the diſeaſes of the Aſian Churches, this was the moſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous that the Church of <hi>Laodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cea</hi>

               <p>Doſt thou put forth thy childe to Nurſe, thou deſireſt that it ſhould thriue and proſper, and not ſtand at a ſtay; if it proſper not, euery one will ſay, the childe will not continue long.

O this is a fearefull ſigne of a ſpirituall conſumption: and
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:42465:169"/>this wee may feare will follow in the end, that God at laſt will bee prouoked to giue ſuch a one ouer to hardneſſe of heart, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate ſence, that haue made no better a vſe of the grace that hath beene offered vnto them.</p>
               <p>And laſt of all,

<pb n="343" facs="tcp:42465:175"/>hindereth the acceſſe of them into his preſence. Now what can be more vncomfortable vnto the ſoule of man, then this? Not to be heard in miſery, when Sathan ſhall tempt vs, ſinne diſquiet vs, troubles oppreſſe vs, death af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fright vs; what is now the laſt refuge of a poore ſoule, but to flie vnto God by prayer. Now, alas, when our prayers ſhall become abhominable, and turned into ſinne, who is then able to put to ſilence the voice of deſperation?</p>
               <p>And on the contrary part, what can bee more comfortable then when troubles and miſeries ſhall corne, ſickneſſe, and death it ſelfe ſhall approach, that we may haue free acceſſe vnto the throne of grace, there to powre out our ſoules into his boſome.

                     <hi>Dauid,</hi> who when he was to pray againſt the enemies of the Church, beholdeth God to bee al-ſufficient, to take vengeance vpon them,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 94.1.</note> 
                     <hi>O Lord God to whom vengeance belongeth, thou God to whom vengeance belongeth, ſhew thy ſelfe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus the Church when they heard that <hi>Peter</hi> was caſt into priſon, goe preſently vnto God in prayer, and therein ſtrengthen themſelues in the conſideration of Gods power.

                  </p>
                  <p>So the Apoſtle Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horting the Corinthians to mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall peace, <hi>liue in peace</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and the God of peace and loue bee with you.</hi> We may ſee this in all
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:42465:192"/>the Apoſtles at ſuch times as they made choyce of one in the rome and place of <hi>Iudas.</hi> They pray that God would direct them therein.
<note place="margin">Acts 1.24.</note> 
                     <hi>Thou God which knoweſt the hearts of all men, ſhew which of theſe two thou haſt choſen.</hi> The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are,</p>

<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſ. </seg>1</label> this is to pray in iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which is required of euery one that would make an effectuall prayer vnto God.
<note place="margin">Pro. 15.8.</note> 
                     <hi>The ſacrifices of the wicked are abhomination vnto the Lord, but the prayer of the righteous is his delight.</hi> And this is indeed to glorifie God in his attributes, who delighteth in his ſeruants, that can make a right vſe of them.</p>
                  <p>Secondly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> this is an excellent prop for the faith of Gods people to leane vpon. When men ſeeke of thoſe that are euery way furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed to ſupply their wants, it is no
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:42465:192"/>ſmall incouragement vnto them to bee earneſt in their ſuits vnto them. Now all fulneſſe and ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency is in God.

                  <p>Thirdly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> the due conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hereof, makes a beleeuer more earneſt and affectionate in prayer, which is a thing wherein the Lord takes much delight. This put life in the ſute of the poore Cananite,

Shee ſaw Chriſts al-ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency,
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:42465:193"/>that hee was able to helpe. Nothing doth better ſtabliſh and ſettle the heart of the childe of God, againſt doubtings and fears, and worke feruency, integrity, and confidence, all which are moſt requiſite in prayer, then the due conſideration of this, that God is all in all, in the very thing it ſelfe we ſeeke vnto him for.</p>
                  <p>This ſerues firſt of all to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne that horrible practice of the Church of Rome,

                  <p>Secondly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> this may alſo ſerue for our inſtruction, that as wee deſire to pray effectually: as wee are to take notice of our owne miſery and preſent neceſſity, ſo withall, to behold in God his al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficiency, and ſuch ſpeciall at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes of his, we ſtand moſt of all in need of. Art thou in miſery and diſtreſſe, conceiue of God in thy prayers, as a mercifull God, and ſuch a one that is full of compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, able and willing to helpe: Thus doth this Penitent here, yea, behold him as <hi>a God of mercy, and Father of all conſolation and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.</hi> Standeſt thou in need of his power to helpe thee? Preſent him vnto thy minde, euen at the firſt entrance into thy prayers, as a powerfull God. And ſo likewiſe for his wiſedome, truth, iuſtice, &amp;c. We euer ſeeke thoſe things
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:42465:194"/>moſt conſtantly and comfortably, when we know them to bee had at his hands, from whom we ſeek them. This being carefully obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of vs, we ſhall finde it a ſtrong prop vnto our faith, and an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent meanes to kindle affection in vs, and ſo a thing moſt vſefull and neceſſary in prayer.</p>

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> the deſire of Gods people of life and ſaluation, as it proceeds from a good ground, and therefore earneſt; So it is euer ioyned with the vſe of the means that God hath appointed for the attaining of eternall ſaluation; ſuch as are the Miniſtery of the Word, the reuerend vſe of the Sacrament, prayer, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Whereas of the wicked, that of <hi>Solomon</hi> is moſt true,
<note place="margin">

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> howſoeuer a wicked man may deſire heauen, eternall life and ſaluation, yet there is euer ſomething that he preferreth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this. The young man in the Goſpell that came to Chriſt, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:42465:201"/>
                     <hi>Good Maſter, what ſhall I do to inherite eternall life?</hi> ſhewed that hee wiſhed well to heauen, and the ſaluation of his ſoule: But being required by Chriſt to ſell all that hee had, and to giue to the poore, and to follow Chriſt,
<note place="margin">Mat. 19.</note> the Text ſaith, <hi>He went away ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</hi> Which ſhewed plainly, that hee loued his wealth better. Whereas the deſire of the godly is ſuch, as that they preferre eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life, and the ſaluation of their ſoules, aboue all things in the world beſides. So <hi>Dauid, Many ſay, who ſhall ſhew vs any good? But Lord grant mee thy counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, thy fauour, and grace.</hi> Where <hi>Dauid</hi> oppoſeth his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire againſt the deſire of world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings; and ſheweth that howſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer worldly men deſire chiefely worldly things, hee for his part did chiefly deſire Gods counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:42465:202"/>fauour and grace in the pardon of his ſinnes, aboue all the world beſides. And indeed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſuch doth the promiſe of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life belong and appertaine; for ſo ſaith the Lord,

                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> howſoeuer the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and the godly deſire eternall life alike, the childe of God onely is wiſe to lay hold vpon the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity whileſt grace is offered, ſeeking that in the firſt place,
<note place="margin">Mat. 6.33.</note> aboue all earthly and tranſitory things; whereas it is the propertie of wicked and vngodly men, to put it off, vntill the day of grace be paſt,
<note place="margin">Luk. 13.25.</note> euen till <hi>the Maſter of the houſe be riſen vp, and hath ſhut to the dore.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fiftly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> there is in the godly, and thoſe that ſhall bee ſaued in the end, a conſtant ſeeking of God, of
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:42465:202"/>eternall life and ſaluation, not by moods and fits, but throughout the whole courſe of their liues. All their thoughts, words, and actions, ſauor of grace within, and tend vnto heauen, and the furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of their eternall happineſſe. Whereas with the wicked, it is not ſo with them, for if they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire eternall life and ſaluation, it is no conſtant deſire, but by fits, either when the Word, or ſome affliction or other hath kindled ſuch a good motion for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent within them, but by and by, <hi>like the morning dew it goeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>And laſt of all,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> there is yet this difference betwixt the godly and the wicked in their deſires. A wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked man deſires mercy, but not grace, the pardon of ſinne, but not the ſpirit of corroboration and ſtrength againſt ſinne. He rather
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:42465:203"/>deſireth freedome from miſery, the effect of ſinne, then from ſinne it ſelfe, the cauſe of miſery: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the childe of God is as earneſt with God for ſtrength againſt his corruptions for the time to come, as the pardon of his ſinne paſt: <hi>Dauid</hi> is as earneſt with God to <hi>ſtabliſh him with his free ſpirit,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 51.12.</note> as to <hi>waſh him from his ſinne.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Well then to conclude this poynt, would we haue any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in our owne ſoules, that wee are amongſt the number of thoſe that hunger and thirſt aright after eternall life and ſaluation, that our deſires proue not to bee like the vaine wiſhes of the wicked, that ſhall not profit them in the end. O let vs then try our ſelues, and examine our owne hearts by the rule of this doctrine. Are we true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſenſible of our owne wretched<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and miſery, by reaſon of ſin?
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:42465:203"/>haue we vſed all holy helpes and meanes, whereby wee may come to the comfortable aſſurance ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of vnto our owneſoules? Haue we learned to prize eternall life and ſaluation aboue all the world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides? haue we made vſe of all op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunites that God hath offered vnto vs for the getting of grace into our ſoules? hath this deſire of ours beene conſtant, and not by fits onely? and haue we as earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſought at Gods hand, ſtrength againſt our corruptions, as the pardon of our ſinnes paſt? Theſe things indeed may miniſter vnto vs a comfortable aſſurance that our deſire of eternall life and ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hath beene true, hath beene vnfained, ſuch as ſhall not miſſe of ſaluation in the end.</p>
                  <p>Whereas if on the contrary part, we neuer yet truely ſaw our miſery, by reaſon of ſinne, haue
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:42465:204"/>euer ſleighted Gods ordinances, preferred the world, our profit and pleaſures, before the euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting ſaluation of our ſoules; haue made no account of the ſeaſon and opportunity of grace offered, haue neither conſtantly deſired, nor for future times ſought ſtrength of God, againſt our cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions; know wee that our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires were neuer true and vnfained, but ſuch as may be in wicked men, that ſhall miſſe of ſaluation in the end.</p>

In hope and expectation are they kept here, liuing by faith: as the Heyre being not of ripe yeares, is not poſſeſt of the inheritance, but after death they come then to bee poſſeſt of that glorious inheritance layd vp for the Saints. This doth this Penitent Theefe acknowledge here in this his requeſt to Chriſt, as if he ſhould ſay; O Lord it is not life for a time which cannot be long, that I ſo much ſtand vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſince death I haue deſerued, I am willing to dye: but it is this I ſpecially deſire aboue al the world beſides, that when this life ſhall haue an end, I may haue a reſting place in thy kingdome. <hi>If in this

It is vſed often both in the old and new Teſtament: And the vſe thereof is twofold.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, it is vſed for an earneſt wiſh and deſire of the heart: and thus when <hi>Dauid</hi> had appointed <hi>Solomon</hi> to be Ruler ouer Iſrael,
<note place="margin">1. King. 1.36.</note> 
                     <hi>Benaiah</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Iehoida</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered <hi>Dauid,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Amen:</hi> therein teſtifying his vnfained deſire that it ſhould bee ſo.

<pb n="416" facs="tcp:42465:213"/>teſtifie our deſire to be heard and anſwered in thoſe things we pray for.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the ſame is vſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine for an earneſt affirmation and aſſeueration, as in that ſpeech of our Sauiour vnto <hi>Nichodemus,</hi> wherein the word is twice toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther repeated, <hi>Amen, Amen, Dico tibi,
<note place="margin">Iob. 3.11.</note> &amp;c.

                  <p>The Doctrine that from hence may be concluded for our Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,

To beleeue aright in Chriſt, is not a worke of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, nor a thing that a naturall man in himſelfe is diſpoſed to, but it is a ſupernaturall worke of Gods Spirit.
<note place="margin">Phil. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>To you it is giuen to beleeue,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> yea it is a work of Gods Almighty power:

                     <hi>That ye may know the greatneſſe of his power to vs ward who beleeue, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the working of his mightie power.</hi> This made the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> to complaine, and to ſay,

                     <note place="margin">Gen. 18.</note> but hee ſeemed vnto them as if he had <hi>mocked.</hi> Wee may ſee this in <hi>Gideon,</hi> he was a man ſent of God to be a deliuerer of the people of Iſrael, the Lord had aſſured him by his Angell that he would deliuer Iſrael out of the hands of the <hi>Midianites</hi> by his hand. Yet he is ſo hardly brought to beleeue this, as that he asketh a ſigne:
<note place="margin">Iudg. 6.14.36.</note> 
                     <hi>If thou wilt ſaue Iſrael by my hands, as thou haſt ſaid, behold I will put a fleece of wooll in the threſhing place,</hi> &amp;c. The like we haue in <hi>Sarah,</hi> albeit ſhee had heard the promiſe that God had made to <hi>Abraham</hi> her husband,
<note place="margin">Gen. 17.16</note> that God would giue her a ſonne,
<note place="margin">Gen. 18.12</note> 
                     <hi>I will bleſſe thee</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>and giue thee a ſonne. She laughed at it.</hi> Which was as much
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:42465:214"/>as if ſhe ſhould haue ſaid, This is a ieſt indeed. Wee may ſee this moſt cleare in the people of Iſrael, though the Lord from time to time had giuen good demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his loue, power, goodneſſe, and mercie towards them, which might haue cauſed that people for euer to haue truſted in his helpe, and neuer to haue deſpaired of the ſame in time of their greateſt need. Yet ſtill when the outward meanes of their deliuerance failed, they beleeued not Gods promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, inſomuch that the Lord a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine and againe complaineth of them:
<note place="margin">Num. 14.11</note> 
                     <hi>How long will this people prouoke me? How long will it bee ere they beleeue mee? for all the ſignes which I haue ſhewed among them?</hi> And, <hi>How oft did they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoke him in the wilderneſſe, and grieued him in the deſert?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The like example of mans im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becilitie
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:42465:215"/>and weakneſſe in belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the promiſes of God. Wee may ſee this in <hi>Zachary,</hi> the father of the <hi>Baptiſt,</hi> who bewrayeth his infidelitie in this, that could not be induced to beleeue the Angell touching a Sonne which <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi> his wife ſhould beare vnto him.
<note place="margin">Luk. 1.13.</note> Which promiſe the Angell amplified for the further confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of his faith. Firſt, by his Office, hee ſhould goe before Chriſt. Secondly, from the graces of God which ſhould be beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vpon him, and the effects of his Miniſterie. Notwithſtanding all this, <hi>Zachary</hi> remaines ſtill in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credulous and diſtruſtfull, ſaying vnto the Angell,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ver. </seg>18</label> 
                     <hi>Whereby ſhall I know this?</hi> The Angel had aſſured <hi>Zachary</hi> before, that the Lord had heard his prayer,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ver. </seg>13</label> 
                     <hi>Feare not Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chary, for thy prayer is heard.</hi> And yet hee is hardly brought to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:42465:215"/>the promiſe. The like wee may ſee in <hi>Peter,</hi> a man full of faith, and the holy Ghoſt; in ſo much that when Chriſt bade him come vpon the Sea,
<note place="margin">Ma. 1.8.</note> hee left the ſhip, but a waue ariſing, his faith failed him. And thus was it with the Virgine <hi>Mary,</hi> when as the Angell came vnto her, and told her that ſhe had found fauour in the ſight of God:
<note place="margin">Luk. 1.39.</note> 
                     <hi>How ſhall this bee</hi> (ſaith ſhe) <hi>ſeeing I know not a man?</hi> It ſeemed to her a ſtrange thing, that ſhe ſhould haue a child when ſhee had not companied with a man. So that let the Lord promiſe immediately by himſelfe, by his Angels, or by men, yet are we hardly brought to beleeue: So hard and difficult a thing in the heart of a man faith is. Neither is this a thing to bee wondered at.</p>

<label type="milestone">

                     <hi>No it is not of our ſelues</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>it is the gift of God.</hi> Nature hath furniſhed vs with no principle at all concerning Chriſt, concerning eternall life, or the ſaluation of our ſoules. And hence it comes to paſſe, that becauſe the meanes whereby God vſually worketh faith in our hearts, and ſo conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſaluation, ſeeme vnto our carnall reaſon to be <hi>vnlikely,</hi> wee preſently reiect them, like <hi>Naa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> when hee was commanded to waſh in Iordane ſeuen times: <hi>Are not</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>Admah and Pharphar,

                  <p>Secondly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> there are many things in the doctrine of ſaluation that are ſcandalous to the wicked. In which reſpect the Apoſtle ſaith,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1.23.</note>

<note place="margin">Rom. 10:</note> 
                     <hi>For how can they beleeue on him on whom they haue not heard?</hi> yet perſwade themſelues that they haue faith as well as the beſt, as if it were ſo eaſie a matter truely to beleeue, which indeed no leſſe power muſt effect in vs, then the <hi>mighty power of God.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Eph. 1.19.</note> Such men doe wonderfully deceiue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues.

                  </p>
                  <p>Yea, but they beleeue, ſay they, all the Articles of the Chriſtian faith, and repeate them daily.

                  <p>Yea, but they come to Church, heare the Word, receiue the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, pray to God, and meane well, though they be not ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe and forward as others are.

Oh the miſerie of euery impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and hard-hearted ſinner, that lieth in ſinne, and ſo vnder the curſes of the Law, hee is as ſure one day to partake of the ſame, as if he were vnder them already.

All which are cleare demonſtrations that the Lord hath a purpoſe to giue them comfort at laſt. Vpon this verie ground <hi>Dauid</hi> concludeth the helpe and deliuerance of Gods
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:42465:249"/>people in diſtreſſe,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 10.17.</note> 
                     <hi>Lord</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>thou heareſt the deſire of the poore: thou prepareſt their heart, and thine eare inclineth thereunto.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, God delaying to helpe his ſeruants by and by in time of miſerie and diſtreſſe, doth prouoke them to pray ſo much the more earneſtly and frequently vnto him, drawing away the heart from the world, and cauſing the ſoule to haue the more ſecret com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with the Almightie, and ſo muſt needs bring comfort in the end:</p>
                  <p>Seeing then that thoſe that ſeeke vnto God,
<label type="milestone">

This may ſerue then in the firſt place to ſtay the godly in the time of their ſoreſt trials, not to deſpaire, not to murmure, repine and complaine, as if their
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:42465:249"/>caſe were deſperate: <hi>For in due time they ſhall reape, if they faint not.</hi> What though for a time they beare the burthen and the heate of the day, when the Euening commeth they ſhall not miſſe of their reward; and then they ſhall ſee, and acknowledge with the Apoſtle,
<note place="margin">Luk. 21.18</note> 
                     <hi>That theſe light and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentany afflictions which are but for a ſeaſon, ſhall bring with them an eternall recompence of reward.</hi> In the meane time let vs <hi>poſſeſſe our ſoules in patience:</hi> tarrie the Lords leaſure, and waite vpon him; our labour ſhall not bee in vaine in the Lord.

<pb n="488" facs="tcp:42465:250"/>vpon him ſhall not bee aſhamed.</p>
                  <p>Secondly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> it may ſerue to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh vs, that we take heed that we do not preuent the Lord, and foreſtall that comfortable iſſue we might haue of our miſeries and afflictions, either by not ſeeking of him, when miſerie is vpon vs, or by vnlawfull wayes and means to ſeeke to come out of them. This is indeed to rob God of that honour that is due vnto him, in waiting for his helpe; and our ſelues of that comfort wee might otherwiſe haue, of a ſeaſonable deliuerance if we had ſought and waited vpon him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thou ſhalt be with me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That is, with the ſoul of Chriſt, for his body went from the croſſe to the graue, q. d. Since thou haſt confeſſed my name, and deſireſt principally the fruition of mee, thou ſhalt be ſatisfied in the thing
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:42465:250" rendition="simple:additions"/>thou deſireſt, <hi>Thou ſhalt be with me.</hi> Note hence,</p>
                  <p>That the ſoules of the faithfull after this life haue the fruition of Chriſt,
<label type="milestone">

                     <note place="margin">The ſouls of the faithfull in death are gathered to Chriſt.</note> and are gathered vnto him. So ſoone as the ſoule goeth out of the body, it goeth imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately to heauen, or hell. The Scripture maketh mention but of two wayes, the <hi>broad,</hi> and the <hi>narrow,</hi> and theſe leade but vnto two places, either to <hi>endleſſe bliſſe,</hi> or into <hi>Euerlaſting torment;</hi> there is a Paradiſe you ſee here for the <hi>Penitent,</hi>

                     <note place="margin">Act. 1.</note> that is, to <hi>Hell,</hi> out of which there is no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption.</p>

                     </label> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard that Chriſt is the head of beleeuers, and they are his body, yea euery true beleeuer is a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of this body.

                     <hi>Father I will that thoſe thou haſt giuen me, be with mee where I am, that they may behold my glory which thou haſt giuen me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This meeteth with the doctrine of <hi>Purgatory</hi> ſo much vrged,

                  <p>When <hi>Paul</hi> directs the Church how they ſhould carry them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>felues towards the <hi>dead,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Phil. 3.</note> he giues no direction at any time to pray for the dead. Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith, <hi>Bleſſed are the dead that dye in the Lord.</hi> And the holy Ghoſt addeth further,
<note place="margin">Reu. 14.13:</note> 
                     <hi>From henceforth they reſt from their labours.</hi> Now to <hi>enter vpon peace,</hi> and to <hi>reſt from their labours,</hi> and yet to ſuffer helliſh torrments for many yeares, are things incompatible, and cannot ſtand together.

                  </p>
                  <p>Surely the Scriptures know no ſuch third place, but that the ſouls of the righteous, ſo ſoone as euer they depart out of the body, they go with the ſoule of this <hi>Penitent</hi> here into <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> or into <hi>heauen</hi> the place of euerlaſting ioy and felicity. And the ſoules of the wicked go immediatly to <hi>Hell,</hi> a place of euerlaſting torment, there is no middle place betwixt theſe. But as there are but two ſorts of perſons, ſo there are but two ſorts of places. Beſides it ſtands not with the rule of Iuſtice, that the ſoule ſhould be puniſhed without the body, ſince the body and the ſoule were copartners together in ſinne. But the Church of Rome
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:42465:253"/>knew well enough what it did to broach this doctrine, and what they do in maintaining the ſame at this day. But we wil leaue them and come vnto our ſelues.</p>
                  <p>This may ſerue for matter of ſingular comfort and conſolation vnto the godly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> that inaſmuch as the ſoules of the faithfull in death are gathered vnto Chriſt; they may comfort themſelues, that this worke of repentance for ſinne, of mortification, of ſanctification, howſoeuer it may ſeeme painfull for a time, yet it will bee gainfull in the end. Let ſuch then comfort their hearts and ſay, <hi>O my ſoule returne thou vnto thy reſt, for the Lord hath beene beneficiall vnto thee.</hi> And ſay with <hi>Dauid,

                     </label> for ſuch is the Lords bounty and goodneſſe towards his ſeruants, taking pleaſure in their proſperity, And hence it is that the Apoſtle writing to the Epheſians,
